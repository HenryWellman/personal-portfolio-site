# Personal-Portfolio-Site
A fast and minimalist Django project for displaying relevant Computer Science information about myself.
Considering this was my first ever attempt at making a proper site, and that this was my first time working
with the Django framework, I am very proud of what I have accomplished. Obviously, it's not perfect, and I will 
continually update the project accordingly, as I get better and more familiar with Django and HTML/CSS! You can
now visit my site at https://henrywellman.com/!

## Challenges I Ran Into
I don't have much html/css experience, so I was constantly looking up documentation to learn how to do things or
add various components and features that I wanted. I also had to learn the basics of the Django framework and what
that really means. Putting the site into production was even more complicated than developing the project itself! I 
had to learn all about web structure, choose the best platform to run it on, (AWS Lightsail Instance) and all the little
configuration steps. I had to learn about how to set up a database with Postgres, communicate with my server via my WSGI Server
Gunicorn, and use the Nginx load balancer to route traffic to my site. Even learning how to register my site's domain was a real
adventure, but I have really learned so much about web development and the way the internet operates through this project!

## What's Next For This Site?
While the site is now in production, I still have a lot of things to add and update to my site. For example, whenever I make a new
project or update my resume, I will still update the site. The same goes with things like photos, or credentials. The next thing I am going to focus on 
is improving my contact form, (I think there is a slight bug when using the site on a phone) and making my search results pages more dynamic based on
the user's search query. This will hopefully make my site feel more professional and sleek, and it is my hope that as I improve as a programmer, my site
will also reflect this growth and end up becoming a very high quality website to impress future employers!
